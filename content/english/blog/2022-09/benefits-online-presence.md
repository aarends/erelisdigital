> ##### What is online presence?
>
> An [online presence](https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/small-business-online-presence-getting-started-website/) for a business is the business website, social profiles, online memberships in directories, and other places on the Internet where customers and potential customers can find you. It is the collective sum of all identities you have created on the Internet.

In today's world many people are on the internet for different reason as to buying stuff, learning and socializing. This means having an online presence is vital for business owners.
Just because a business exists and it has good product and service, doesn't mean they are going to make sales. They have to reach the potential customers for the product or service. That is marketing.

Let's see top 4 reasons why a local business owner of a Small to Midsize Business can benefit from having a personal website.

##### Why should you invest in a website for your business?

1. **Brand**

    The website is the place where people go first to learn about your product or service and to find information about your business. Just because your business doesn’t have a website doesn’t mean that it isn’t already online. There are review sites like Yelp or Trip Advisor that allow consumers to discuss their good and bad experiences with businesses. Owning a website gives you the opportunity to communicate your brand directly to your customers and build relationships.

2. **Credibility and trust**

    Credibility in business makes a company's reputation. One way to create trust with your potential customers and increase your business credibility is to own a website. A website is like a virtual business card for a company.
    A survey conducted by [Verisign](https://blog.verisign.com/domain-names/why-small-businesses-say-having-a-website-is-important/) shows that globally 72 percent of today’s consumers think a website makes your business out as being more credible than companies who only have and use social media profiles.

3. **Expand Your Working Hours**

    There is a saying "If you want to make money while you sleep, build a system that doesn't sleep." A website is the online home base of your business and it will promote your business 24 hours a day and seven days a week. A website can help you find potential customers and increase sales even though you are not available.

4. **Attract new customers through Google**

    According to online reviews statistics and [ReviewTrackers](https://www.reviewtrackers.com/reports/online-reviews-survey/) data, 63.6% of consumers say they are likely to check Google reviews (through Google Maps and Search) before visiting a business location.

    By having an optimized Search Engine Optimization (SEO) website, you have a good chance of appearing on the first page of Google's search result.

    When people search for any product or service, your website has a chance of showing up in the search results. When this happens, people would want to check the information you have on your website. This creates the opportunity of having more customers buy your products.

    In addition, a website will allow you to reach even the international customers by breaking the geographical barriers. The more attention it gets the more sales opportunity arises.
